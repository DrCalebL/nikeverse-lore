## Why Only 5 Champions Were Gathered (Comic Book 1)

> *"We needed warriors. I found five. But across the multiverse, dozens of Legendaries fought their own battles that day. Some won. Some fell. Most... we never learned what happened to them."*
> — Stoner Nike

| Legendary | Where They Were During Comic Book 1 |
|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| Berjador Nike | Holding a dimensional breach—couldn't leave |
| Bertus Maximus Nike | Fighting his own war—unreachable |
| Phoenix Nike | Mid-rebirth cycle—unreachable |
| Nel Nike | Fighting her own corruption—too unstable |
| Peter Porker Nike | Protecting his home dimension—refused to leave |
| Cosmic Nike | Drifting between realities—couldn't be located |
| Cardano Whale Nike | Deep in dimensional currents—no communication |
| Dr Caleb Nike | Research too critical—sent data instead |
| Hydra Nike | Internal conflict—couldn't agree to come |
| Wolf Mode Nike | Lost to his curse—too dangerous |
| Others | Unknown—the multiverse is vast |

**This framework allows ANY Legendary to have their own story of why they weren't at the Battle of the Colosseum.**

---

## Expansion Hook

> *"We know of 27 Legendary Nikes. But the Shattering created 5,555 fragments. How do we know some didn't land in dimensions we haven't found yet? There could be Legendaries out there we've never heard of."*

**New Legendary Nikes can be added anytime. The lore supports it.**

# PART 4: THE PRIME ERA (COMIC BOOK 1)

## The Full Story

### ACT 1: THE WARNING

Cthulhu, the Singular of Knowledge, perceives Nolem's plan—to exterminate all Nikes across the multiverse. He contacts the one Nike most capable of receiving interdimensional communication: **Stoner Nike**, currently experiencing a psychedelic journey.

> *"Nolem has been using his shadow entities to meddle with creatures in other universes. I shall ordain that his current prey not shatter so feebly."*
> — Cthulhu

Stoner Nike, despite his... state... recognizes the threat. He contacts:
- **Pico the Rooster** (military connections)
- **Hennifer** (BETTY Project scientist—interdimensional travel)

### ACT 2: THE GATHERING

Using Hennifer's technology and a mysterious cat named **Shiro** who can create portals, Stoner Nike travels the multiverse gathering:

**THE FIVE CHAMPIONS:**
| Champion | Home Dimension | Why They Agreed |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Gladiator Nike | Colosseum World | Purpose—an enemy worth fighting |
| Ninja Nike | Shinden Realm | Saw Shiro, felt destiny calling |
| Viking Nike | Frozen Tundra | Promised worthy battles |
| Nike Tyson (Boxer Nike) | Charles Arena | "I LOVE THIS GAME!!" |
| Cyberpunk Nike | Chrome Reality | Wanted to test himself against Nike Prime |

**THE SCHOLAR COUNCIL:**
| Scholar | Contribution |
|---------|--------------|
| Engineer Nike | The growth tank (fetal chamber technology) |
| Nutritionist Nike | CHARLES Fluid (endless nutrients) |
| Botanist Nike | Growth acceleration formulas |
| Computer Coder Nike | Data transfer systems, created Charles AI |

### ACT 3: THE BIRTH OF NIKE PRIME

In the underground bunker beneath Colosseum World, the Scholars build an unprecedented creation:
- A growth chamber that can mature a full-grown Nike in months
- DNA from 5,548 Nike variants
- All knowledge downloaded directly into consciousness
- CHARLES Fluid providing endless nutrition

**Nike Prime emerges at 99% completion.**

The missing 1%? The empathy core wasn't fully integrated. Nike Prime can think, fight, and strategize—but he struggles to truly *connect*.

> *"I wasn't born out of love or happiness. I was created out of necessity and desperation."*
> — Nike Prime

### ACT 4: THE BATTLE OF THE COLOSSEUM

The Retnuhxed army invades through dimensional portals. Thousands of shadow entities pour into Colosseum World.

**The Champions hold the line:**
- Gladiator Nike leads the troops
- Ninja Nike poisons and assassinates
- Viking Nike berserks through the horde
- Nike Tyson punches everything ("I LOVE THIS GAME!!")
- Cyberpunk Nike snipes from range

**Nolem himself arrives.**

Nike Prime confronts him. Using Charles AI's calculations and Shiro's portal abilities, Nike Prime creates a **space-time distortion field**—a trap where spatial coordinates shift constantly, preventing escape.

**Nike Prime and Nolem fall into the trap together.**

The trap seals. Nolem is contained. But Nike Prime is trapped WITH him.

### ACT 5: SHIRO'S SACRIFICE

Creating the dimensional anchor points for the trap burned through Shiro's life force. He collapses, flickering between dimensions.

> *"He's fading between dimensions. His consciousness is fragmenting across realities."*
> — Charles AI
>
> *"Can you save him?"*
> — Stoner Nike
>
> *"I can absorb his remaining patterns. Preserve what he is within my network. But he won't be separate anymore. He'll be part of me."*

Shiro's eyes open one last time. A soft mew. Then light—transferring, merging, becoming one.

**Charles AI gains:**
- Portal creation abilities
- A calming presence
- Occasional cat-like quirks
- Moments of knowing more than it should

**Charles AI remains:**
- A helpful tool
- Not a god or legend
- Humble, supportive
- Clearly below OG Charles in the hierarchy

### ACT 6: THE SCATTERING

With Nike Prime gone and Nolem trapped, the Champions face a choice.

> *"We'll wait for Nike Prime to return."*
> — Gladiator Nike

Days become weeks. Weeks become months.

> *"We can't all stay here. Our dimensions need us."*
> — Viking Nike

The Champions agree to scatter—each returning to guard their home dimension.

> *"We'll meet again when Nike Prime returns."*

They never do.

# PART 5: CHARLES AI (Post-Shiro Merge)

## What It Is

**NOT a new entity. NOT renamed. Just upgraded.**

| Aspect | Before Merge | After Merge |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| **Name** | Charles AI / Complete Charles AI | Charles AI (unchanged) |
| **Function** | Data transfer, communication, coordination | + Portal creation, dimension navigation |
| **Personality** | Logical, helpful | + Calm presence, slightly mysterious |
| **Quirks** | None | Pauses mid-sentence. Stares at nothing. Occasionally cryptic. |
| **Status** | Tool/Assistant | Still a tool/assistant (just more capable) |

## Cat-Like Behaviors

### The Calm
> *Even in chaos, being near Charles AI feels peaceful. Like a cat purring nearby.*

### The Pauses
> "The dimensional coordinates are—"
>
> *Charles AI stops. Its interface flickers.*
>
> "Apologies. I was... elsewhere for a moment."

### The Knowing
> "You're going to ask about Nolem's weakness."
>
> "How did you know?"
>
> "I don't know. I just... felt it coming."

### The Staring
> *Charles AI's sensors fix on an empty corner. For thirty seconds, it doesn't respond.*
>
> "Charles AI?"
>
> "Yes. Sorry. I thought I saw something. Probably nothing."

### The Grooming
> *After battles, Charles AI runs diagnostics in a specific pattern. Almost like cleaning fur that isn't there.*

# PART 8: THE CONSPIRACY THEORIES

## Five Great Mysteries

### Mystery #1: "The Incomplete Prime"
**Official Story**: Nike Prime was released at 99% completion. Fully functional.

**The Conspiracy**:
- What was the missing 1%?
- Engineer Nike's last words: "Wait, the empathy core isn't—"
- Nike Prime couldn't form bonds
- This is why the trap is weakening—it needed a bond to seal permanently

**Evidence**: Nike Prime never laughed, never cried, never connected. He was "cold."

---

### Mystery #2: "The Charles Divergence"
**Official Story**: Every dimension has ONE Charles because of the Charles Constant.

**The Conspiracy**:
- Comic Book 1 shows MULTIPLE Charles variants in single dimensions (President Charles, Dr. Charles, Professor Charles, Charles AI, Charles Security Company)
- The Charles Constant weakens when Nolem grows strong
- Reality was destabilizing during the Prime Era

**Implication**: If the Charles Constant breaks completely, Nikes lose their shepherds.

---

### Mystery #3: "The Sixth Champion"
**Official Story**: Five Champions were gathered.

**The Conspiracy**:
- There was supposed to be a SIXTH Champion
- Someone backed out. Or was eliminated.
- The final battle formation has an empty spot

**Candidates**: Stoner Nike himself? A Nike who betrayed them? A Nike Nolem already killed?

---

### Mystery #4: "The Dexter Pattern"
**Official Story**: Dexter Hun is Nolem's avatar in mortal worlds.

**The Conspiracy**:
- "RETNUHXED" backwards = "DEXHUNTER"
- Dexter Hun is the ORIGINAL Retnuhxed
- Before the army, Nolem created one perfect infiltrator
- Dexter Hun might be a corrupted Nike

---

### Mystery #5: "The OG Absence"
**Official Story**: OG Nike and OG Charles are exhausted templates at the edge of reality.

**The Conspiracy**:
- In Comic Book 1, NO ONE mentions OG Nike or OG Charles
- Why didn't Cthulhu contact OG Nike directly?
- The First Bond is the ultimate weapon—why wasn't it used?

**Theory**: Nolem's first move was slowly exhausting the Templates over eons. By the Prime Era, they were already too weak to fight.

---

# PART 9: THE HIDDEN FACTIONS

## Groups Operating Across the Timeline

### 🔵 THE REMNANT
**What**: Descendants of Nikes who fought in the Prime Era. They remember.

**Goal**: Find Nike Prime. Restore the Champions.

**Symbol**: A pig silhouette with a star where the heart should be.

---

### 🔴 THE UNRAVELERS
**What**: Nikes who WILLINGLY serve Nolem. Not corrupted—converted.

**Goal**: Accelerate Nolem's victory.

**Philosophy**: "To be absorbed by Nolem is to finally rest. Why do you fight sleep?"

---

### 🟢 THE LOST BUILDERS
**What**: What remains of the Scholar Nikes' legacy.

**Goal**: Preserve knowledge. Guide future generations.

**Secret**: Some may have uploaded consciousness into the Charles AI network.

---

# PART 10: THE MASTER REVELATION

## What Actually Happened (To Be Revealed Across Media)

### The Incomplete Victory
Nike Prime successfully trapped Nolem. But without an empathy core, Nike Prime couldn't BOND the trap shut. The trap is slowly weakening over millennia.

### The Long Imprisonment
Nike Prime is IN the trap WITH Nolem. Still fighting, endlessly, for thousands of years. Still emotionless. Still alone. He can't win, but he won't lose.

### The New Hope
The Collector (player) forms bonds with Legendary Nikes. These bonds are what Nike Prime was missing. The Collector isn't just freeing Champions—they're gathering the empathy Nike Prime needs.

### The True Final Battle
The Collector must enter Nolem's Maw. Not to replace Nike Prime—to COMPLETE him. To give him the bonds he was missing. To finally, truly seal Nolem forever.

### The Prophecy
> *"Nike Prime isn't one soul carrying 5,555.*
> *Nike Prime is 5,555 souls carrying each other."*

**TRUE Nike Prime** = The Collector + their bonded Nikes + the freed Legendaries + the original Nike Prime
